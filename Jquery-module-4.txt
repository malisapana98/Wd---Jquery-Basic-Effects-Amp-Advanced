Jquery


Q-1) What Is Object Oriented Programming?
     
     jQuery is a lightweight, "write less, do more", JavaScript library.

     The purpose of jQuery is to make it much easier to use JavaScript on your website.

     jQuery takes a lot of common tasks that require many lines of JavaScript code to accomplish, and wraps them into 

     methods that you can call with a single line of code.

     jQuery also simplifies a lot of the complicated things from JavaScript, like AJAX calls and DOM manipulation.

     The jQuery library contains the following features:

               *   HTML/DOM manipulation

               *   CSS manipulation

               *   HTML event methods

               *   Effects and animations

               *   AJAX

               *   Utilities


Q-2) How are JavaScript and jQuery different?

   JavaScript:->

   JavaScript is a crucial scripting language for enhancing website interactivity and responsiveness. It complements HTML and CSS,
 
   adding dynamism to web pages. Besides web development, JavaScript powers desktop/server programs (e.g., Node.js) and certain 

   databases like MongoDB and CouchDB.


Q-3) Which is the starting point of code execution in jQuery?

     The jQuery starts its code execution from the $(document). ready() function which is executed whenever the whole 

     HTML DOM is loaded and is totally rendered by the browser, so that the event handlers work correctly without any errors.


Q-4) Document Load Vs Window. Load() jQuery
     
     The window load event is fired when the entire web page has been loaded. This includes the page DOM and all dependent 

     resources such as scripts, stylesheets, and images. The document DOMContentLoaded event is fired when the page 

     DOM has been loaded and all deferred scripts have been loaded and executed.


Q-5) What is the difference between prop and attr?

     The prop() method provides a way to explicitly retrieve property values, while . attr() retrieves attributes. For example, selectedIndex , 

     tagName ,nodeName , nodeType , ownerDocument , defaultChecked , and defaultSelected should be retrieved and set with the .

 
Q-6) How We Can Select The Specified <li> Element From The ListOf <li>Elements In <ul>?  

     <ul>
    <li id="id-1" class="id-1" data-id="1">Element</li>
    </ul>  



Q-7) How We Can Implement Animation Effects In Jquery?

     The required params parameter defines the CSS properties to be animated.

     The optional speed parameter specifies the duration of the effect. It can take the following values: "slow", "fast", or milliseconds.

     The optional callback parameter is a function to be executed after the animation completes.

     The following example demonstrates a simple use of the animate() method; it moves a <div> element to the right, until it has reached 

     a left property of 250px:

Syntax:->$(selector).animate({params},speed,callback);
